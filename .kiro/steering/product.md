# Product Overview

LineMind is an AI-powered production management system for manufacturing environments. The MVP demonstrates a complete cycle of demand forecasting, production mix optimization, and workforce scheduling.

## Core Value Proposition

- Improve production planning accuracy through demand forecasting
- Reduce changeover costs via optimal model-to-line assignment
- Optimize labor costs with constraint-aware workforce scheduling

## Target Users

Production managers in manufacturing facilities (specifically automotive parts manufacturing) who need to:
- Predict future production volumes for multiple models
- Allocate models to production lines efficiently
- Schedule workers while respecting labor regulations and minimizing costs

## Key Workflows

1. **Forecast Flow**: Generate 30-day production forecasts for each model using historical data
2. **Optimize Flow**: Assign models to production lines considering capacity, changeover costs, and demand
3. **Schedule Flow**: Assign workers to shifts based on production plans, respecting work hour limits and shift rules

## Language

All UI labels, messages, and documentation should use Korean (한글) for the target manufacturing audience.
